MARKET RESEARCH

I have a simple process if you want to follow. You don't need any fancy tools, Reddit is actually the best place for market research. And excel is the best place to record your findings.

Open Reddit, search the sniper desire that the product benefit is meant to solve. For example "Get rid of under-eye bags" “struggling with weight problems” “how to lose weight” “struggling with arthritis.” Read through all Reddit posts and comments. As you read through these posts, start copying and pasting snippets of all points mentioned below. Do not write in your own words. Do not summarise. When we come back to our recordings to write sales copy we want to see what language they use. We want to be reminded of the pain/frustration they felt.

-Copy and paste potential detailed avatars that reveal themselves. Soccer mom. Hiker.

-Copy and paste snippets of before state "what keeps them up at night.” “This is so demotivating, I can’t play with my grandchildren anymore, I wish things could go back to how they used to be” “I’m in so much pain I can’t sleep at night”

-Copy and paste snippets of after state “I tried so and so, and this is how is positively affected my life”

-Copy and paste solutions that they recommended. *Only if they are repeated and popular.

-Copy and paste products they've tried and what they liked/disliked about them. *Only if they are repeated and popular.

-Copy and paste objections to current products or methods. *Only if they are repeated and popular.

-Copy and paste causes of the current issue.

As you do this, avatars & potential ad messages/hooks/emotions will begin to reveal themselves.

-Copy and paste who avatars look up to, what magazines/forums they read, celebrities they follow, T.V shows they watch?

Hope this helps.

COMPETITOR RESEARCH

Pleasure man! And completely agree with your original post, research is super important. Just to add though, I like to compare my avatar research to my competitor research. If they are doing similar to something I found in my avatar research, this is usually a good starting point. Here's how I do my competitor research. Very similar process.

-Search for similar E-COMMERCE products on Amazon select ones with the most reviews.

-Read product descriptions. Record their unique selling propositions (USPs?)

-Read all reviews of competitor products on amazon & Takealot. Avoid reading 5-star reviews. These are usually fake. Most valuable insights come from 4,3,2,1 star reviews.

-Record common snippets of problems people HATE with existing products.

-Record common snippets of what people LOVE about existing products.

Above will let you know what product features/benefits you'll need to highlight, and what people don't want. For example WITHOUT/OBJECTIONS section.

-Fill out ‘How we compare.’ How do their ingredients and features compare to ours? --What should we highlight in our product and what should we dull down?

-Record any before and after state desires/emotions if you come across


------------------------------------------------


why don't you identify 10-20 people/companies in your ideal client base and reach out to them - ask them what their biggest problem is, ask them how they think they could solve it, how much they would pay for it, etc, tell them what you're idea is and see how they respond.

validation is a continuum - at the idea stage it can be agreement to the idea, at mvp phase it should be payment for the MVP, etc. you should always be talking with your target market to understand how their problems and your solution mesh together - especially as your solution starts to come together.




—--------------------------------------------------------



I've done the legwork (via surveys, googling, talking to the targeted users)

This is not validation testing. This is user research/ux research. These actions give you a better understanding of user-types, user flows, user behaviors, demographics/psychographics, competitors in the space, market data, and user patterns in relation to how they seek out and obtain the benefits you hope the experience you are designing will deliver.

to ensure there is a need

Those actions do not validate/ensure there is a need. It's giving you a bit of a feeling that there is a want for it though.

In none of those cases are you requiring a person to make a commitment.

In one of those cases you are requiring a person to seriously weigh the risk vs reward of a commitment.

In each of those cases you are getting someone to give you an answer that they do not need to stand by that requires little more than a small amount of energy and time.

In each of those cases a person is only dealing in hypotheticals.

Examples:

"Would you use this if it existed?"

"What would you like to have if you could design it?"

"How much would you be willing to pay for this if you could get it right now?"

Usually, they are willing to give you that out of curiosity and the attention they are receiving. They get to feel like they matter for the moment you are inquiring about THEIR opinion/feelings/thoughts.

Furthermore, in all of those cases you're only glossing over potential for there to be an existing problem for you to solve. In no way are you identifying if YOUR product/service is the correct solution to that problem.

how else you would conduct a validation test

Proper validation testing involves giving the perception that the service/product can be obtained now/soon through a commitment of time/energy/money (this one being the most heavily weighted commitment you can ask for in the earliest stages of validation testing).

In this basic scenario a person isn't dealing with a hypothetical situation.

They are being required to weigh their decision in a real situation where they will be trading something for your product/service.

They are being required to commit something real in exchange for your product/service.

This can be done without actually giving them anything. This can be done without actually building/coding anything really.

The key factor is the perception you create that requires a person to make these real decisions.

Super Lean Simple Example:

Create a landing page that is designed to give a person the expectation of being able to obtain the product/service. Just like you would if the product/service actually existed and was obtainable.

Have a price posted (if you are charging for your product/service)

Have a call to action button to download, buy, or sign up as a user

Spit a notification that lets them know something along the lines of, "Sorry! We are at capacity right now! If you would like to be added to the mailing list, input your email address and you'll be the first to know when you can get [product/service]"

Record how many people actually try to download/buy/sign up

Obtain email addresses for those eager enough to join the waiting list

Now, you have some actual validation (not super strong validation but, it's real validation in comparison to the above research methods).

This is something basic that is explained in the Lean Startup by Eric Ries.

Another More Elaborate Example:

Create a landing page that is designed to give a person the expectation of being able to obtain the product/service. Just like you would if the product/service actually existed and was obtainable.

Create an onboarding process if it isn't a product/service to pay for (it doesn't need to record any of their data at all...just give them the impression the fields work.)

Create a payment process with a price and terms for your product/service if it is something to be paid for (again, it doesn't need to work...it just needs to give the impression it does)

Have submit buttons record who actually tried to register as a user/who actually inputted payment information to buy it

Send those submitting information to a notification page that informs them of something like, ""Sorry! We are at capacity right now! If you would like to be added to the mailing list, input your email address and you'll be the first to know when you can get [product/service]"

In both of these cases you're validation problem/solution fit.

You're identifying that there is clearly a problem and that YOUR product/service has the potential to solve it. This is what very early stage validation is geared towards proving in the bigger picture of milestones you should be working towards.

Kickstarter/IndieGoGo/Presales are all great ways to conduct more serious validation tests as well.

Keep in mind that true validation comes in relation to achieving product/market fit.

That's when you have a substantial percentage of your userbase/customer base that are repeat/loyal customers/users.

It's when those core users would feel a disruption in their routine if your service/product ceased to exist.

Product/Market fit is validating that YOUR product/service is the solution people want to use to solve the problem you identified in your early testing.

Also, never forget you can easily lose that product/market fit if you're not constantly testing and improving the experience you are delivering to your users/customers.
