I don’t like what engineers become


This is a quote from the legendary bill burr on his tour on milwaukee. He went there to watch midget wrestling, perform and smoke cigars.

Quote

I was sitting smoking a  cigar with uh Tony V outside the tent and we're just  laughing before we even get out there and I just looked at him I was like dude this gig is every  reason why I got into this business. I did not want to have a real job. I just wanted to have fun hanging out with a bunch of people that wanted to do that - Bill burr

Jobs at software companies are typically advertised in terms of the difficult problems that need solving, the impact the project will have, the benefits the company provides, the playful color of the bean bag chairs. Likewise, jobs in other fields have their own set of metrics that they use to position themselves within their domains.

As a young person, though, I think the best thing you can do is to ignore all of that and simply observe the older people working there.

They are the future you. Do not think that you will be substantially different. Look carefully at how they spend their time at work and outside of work, because this is also almost certainly how your life will look. It sounds obvious, but it’s amazing how often young people imagine a different projection for themselves.

Look at the real people, and you’ll see the honest future for yourself.

How do I observe the engineers? By scraping blind.
