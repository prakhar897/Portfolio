            <h1>Envisioning a future with GPT</h1>

            <h3>
                <i> 16 Apr 2023 </i>
            </h3>

            <p>
                I've penned down a few things about how I think the future will
                look like as GPT and its application grows. These are just
                opinions that could be wrong, but it's better to discuss where
                we're going instead of moving forward blindly.
            </p>

            <h2>Texts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Writing side</b>: people will write their ideas in
                    points, then use GPT to make a full fleshed article.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Reading side</b>: people already hate reading long texts.
                    Now if they really have to, they'll use GPT to summarize it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The emerging result will be:
                    <img src="../images/blog/comm_after_gpt/pic1.jpg" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some people might stop doing the above charade and start
                    writing in bullet points only. This form of writing is
                    already prevalent in greentexts and works quite well there.
                    <img src="../images/blog/comm_after_gpt/pic2.webp" />
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Blogging</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Comment threads on sites like reddit, hackernews generally
                    have very meaty discussions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    GPT can now flesh out articles from these threads at light
                    speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I actually reached front page and briefly to the top of
                    HackerNews using this. (although I did manually intervene a
                    lot).
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a result,
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            All handwritten texts will be pumped into LLMs with
                            no benefit passed to the author.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Handwritten blogs will fail to scale and will
                            eventually die out as a career. There will still be
                            hobby blogs but they won't generate significant
                            revenues.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cold Outreach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We will start getting incredibly personalized messages for
                    jobs, investing, ads etc. I'm also contributing to this
                    dystopia by creating this exact product.

                    It will get increasingly difficult for Mail clients to block
                    this spam. People who read messages from unknown sources
                    will be punished and will eventually stop reading them
                    altogether.

                    Open Inboxes will die.

                    Online Dating will get really weird. There's no way to know
                    whether you're talking to a human or a bot. I think chatting
                    phase will be skipped completely in favor of in person
                    meetings.

                    Scams will become more nuanced. LLMs' ability to confidently
                    roll with the punches, no matter what a user throws at them,
                    will prove useful to scammers as they navigate hostile,
                    bemused, and gullible scam targets by the billions.

                    People might ask you to say offensive stuff to verify you're
                    actually a human behind the screen.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    History will be re-written due to such speedy text
                    generation. There will be no way to distinguish real from
                    fake texts.

                    Measuring public opinion will become more and more
                    difficult. Congressional staff uses the internet to read
                    policy analyses and gauge public opinion - This wouldn't be
                    possible anymore.
