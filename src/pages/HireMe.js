                I've worked in Companies like OYO (AirBnB for India), Amazon in

                In OYO, I was part of <b>Search and Ranking Team</b>. We

                by 15%, resulting in 100,000,000$+ gain of gross margin value
                for the startup.

                After that, I moved to <i>Amazon</i> as a Full Stack Engineer.
                My job there consisted of talking with stakeholders, creating
                specs for MVP, designing and implementing the actual code, and
                then maintaining and iterating upon the product. I also took
                part in creating the roadmap and north star vision for projects.
                I was involved from inception, to creation to maintaining and
                scaling the products.

            <h2>Things I can do for You</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Rent my brain to write code, design systems, give programming
                advice or discover ways to optimize your startup / business.
            </blockquote>
            <h2>1. MVP Development</h2>
            <p>
                I've worked in lots of different fronts of programming. I have
                created frontends, backends of various sites. Created ML models,
                Data Pipelines for apps too. I've hosted various apps sometimes
                using AWS and K8s, other times using managed solutions like
                Heroku etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, I can create whatever you have in mind and would be able
                to iterate quickly. Founders need more assistance from the
                engineers than just building their app. I am able to help with
                things like determining feasibility of their idea, refining
                future requirements, anticipating hurdles, scalability of their
                product, cost estimation, timelines etc. Essentially, I act as a
                Tech Cofounder while you look for one.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>2. Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                If you already have a Team and a working product, I can help you
                deliver new features. I also have a great eye for the overall
                architecture and I dare to challenge the status quo in healthy
                doses. If you are looking to enhance your team, I'd be happy to
                be on board.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Technical Consulting</h2>
            <b> Completely Free </b>
            <p>
                If you're non technical and looking for some opinion on any
                technical topic, I'm happy to help! You can schedule a meeting
