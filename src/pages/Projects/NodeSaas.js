    <p>
        Inspired By alecrocute's flaskSaas. I've noticed SaaS bootstraps/boilerplates being sold upwards of $1,000 per
        year and I think that's ridiculous. This project will be my attempt to make a great starting point for
        your next big business as easy and efficent as possible.
