					Disclaimer: I've sold this extension to a private investor

				</b>
				A tool that enables users to workaround restrictions imposed on
				ChatGPT. <br /> <br />
				Censorship by ChatGPT can sometimes lead to limited or censored
				results, but WorkaroundGPT provides a solution by offering the
				latest jailbreaks that bypass these restrictions. <br /> <br />
				It's time consuming to scour forums for latest workaround
				yourself and there's a good possibility that the prompt you find
				might already be patched. Hence, users can use this extension
				where I'll do all the legwork for you. <br /> <br />
