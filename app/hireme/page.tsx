			<h2>How I Work</h2>

			<p>
				I usually work with teams that already have clarity on the
				problem and want to invest in solving it well. I care deeply
				about architecture, trade-offs, and engineering decisions that
				won't slow the team down later.
			</p>

			<h2>Contract engineering</h2>

			<p>
				I work with teams on a contract basis to help ship and stabilize
				production systems. My experience includes frontend, backend,
				data systems, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure. I'm
				most comfortable working with Javascript, Node.js, React and
				AWS.
			</p>

			<h2>Architecture & system design</h2>

			<p>
				I help teams think through scalability, performance, cost, and
				technical risk early, before these become production issues.
			</p>

			<h2>Technical advice</h2>

			<p>
				For leadership teams and non-technical stakeholders, I provide
				clear, actionable technical guidance. This includes architecture
				reviews, feasibility assessments, and second-opinion consulting
				on product or infrastructure decisions.
			</p>
