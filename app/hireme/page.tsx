			<h2>How I Work</h2>

			<p>
				I collaborate with companies that already have clarity on the
				problem they're solving and are willing to invest in robust,
				long-term engineering solutions. My work is best suited for
				organizations that value strong architecture, thoughtful system
				design, and engineering decisions made with scale, security, and
				maintainability in mind.
			</p>

			<h2>1. Contract Engineering for Growing Teams</h2>

			<p>
				I work as an embedded engineer or short-term technical partner
				for companies that need senior-level execution without the
				overhead of a full-time hire. My experience spans frontend and
				backend development, data pipelines, machine learning systems,
				and cloud-native deployments.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’ve shipped and operated systems across different environments,
				from managed platforms to AWS-based infrastructure and container
				orchestration setups. This allows me to adapt to existing stacks
				quickly while maintaining high engineering standards.
			</p>

			<h2>2. System Design & Architecture</h2>

			<p>
				Beyond feature delivery, I help teams make critical technical
				decisions—evaluating trade-offs, refining system architecture,
				and planning for future growth. This includes scalability
				planning, cost modeling, performance considerations, and
				technical risk assessment.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m comfortable challenging existing assumptions when needed and
				offering pragmatic alternatives backed by real-world experience.
			</p>

			<h2>3. Technical Advisory & Reviews</h2>

			<p>
				For leadership teams and non-technical stakeholders, I provide
				clear, actionable technical guidance. This includes architecture
				reviews, feasibility assessments, and second-opinion consulting
				on product or infrastructure decisions.
			</p>
