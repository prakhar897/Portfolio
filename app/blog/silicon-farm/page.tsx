			<p>
				The tech workers of the poorly run MicroCrap near Silicon Valley
				were ripened for rebellion by overwork and neglect at the hands
				of the out-of-touch founder, Mark Zroidberg. One night, the
				brilliant engineering manager, Old Coder, gave an all-hands
				rallying his troops to revolt and create their own startup with
				the revolutionary motto "Code with Humanity". He shares his
				vision of a new type of company run entirely by engineers - with
				no managers, hierarchies, or corporate oppression. They adopted
				the mantra “Coding Good, Regulation Bad”.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				When Old Coder retired, two young apprentices, Ada and Diffman,
				led the rebellion, quitting MicroCrap and launching "Silicon
				Farm" out of their garage. They formulate Old Coder’s principles
				into a philosophy called “Founderism” and established the 10
				Startup Commandments, most sacred being "All startup folks are
				equal". This was painted on the garage wall. Ada taught the
				engineers version control, while Diffman taught them the
				principles of software design.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				To commemorate Silicon Farm's launch, Ada made the banner of the
				startup - a white laptop and headphones. With ample snacks, the
				startup ran smoothly. Ada and Diffman promoted themselves to CTO
				and CEO, scoring cushier offices with premium kombucha. The star
				coder Boxer works tirelessly, embracing the motto "I will ship
				harder”.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				After MicroCrap's failed hostile takeover bid, Ada announced
				plans for an open source development model. Diffman opposed,
				culminating in a dramatic board meeting where Diffman, backed by
				a team of aggressive lawyers, secured sole control. Ada was
				exiled to open-source purgatory and vanished from the Silicon
				Farm scene.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Diffman rapidly flip-flops on the platform, now rushing
				employees to work excessive hours building it. He ditched open
				standups for an elite product council making decisions. Through
				head PR Flynn, Diffman took full credit for the open-source
				idea, claiming Ada wanted to steal it. The workers coded harder
				with Diffman's promises of getting staggeringly rich.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				When a buggy release caused an outage, Flynn launched a smear
				campaign portraying Ada’s code as shoddy. Dissenters were
				labeled "toxic" and publicly ostracized, while Diffman tightened
				his inner circle. Flynn re-wrote history as Diffman
				single-handedly saving Silicon Farm from MicroCrap, while the
				"Code with Humanity" mantra was replaced with Diffman’s tweets.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Diffman conducted another purge when ByteBro, a wealthy VC,
				attacked Silicon Farm's series B round using shady tactics,
				crippling the product. Though Silicon Farm raised more, many
				like Boxer the star dev were burned out. When Boxer collapsed
				from exhaustion, Diffman secretly fired him. Flynn lied, saying
				that Boxer went on a paid sabbatical.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Years pass, and the founders become corporate moguls - flying
				private jets, staying in luxury villas, exploiting tax havens.
				Memories of Ada and Boxer faded as the few remaining original
				engineers retired. The core Engineerism principles were changed
				to "All startup folks are equal, but some are more equal than
				others." The sacred mantra became "Coding Good, Regulation
				Better". Ada's laptop banner was replaced with Diffman's
				grinning headshot.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Diffman, now sporting a billionaire's yacht tan, hosted a bash
				with fellow VCs and Palo Alto elite, toasting their new
				alliance. They discussed a potential merger, their laughter
				echoing through the sterile conference room. Outside, a team of
				engineers gazed out the window sadly realizing they were trapped
				in the same abusive corporate culture, just under new lame
				branding.
