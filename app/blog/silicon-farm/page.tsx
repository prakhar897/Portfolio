			<p>
				The tech workers of the poorly run MicroCrap were ripened for
				rebellion by overwork and neglect at the hands of the
				out-of-touch founder, Mark Zroidberg. One night, the brilliant
				engineering manager, Old Coder, gave an all-hands rallying his
				troops to revolt and create their own startup with the
				revolutionary motto "Code with Humanity". He shares his vision
				of a new type of company run entirely by engineers - with no
				managers, hierarchies, or corporate oppression. They adopted the
				mantra “Coding Good, Regulation Bad”.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				When Old Coder retired, his two young apprentices, Ada and
				Diffman, led the rebellion, quitting MicroCrap and launching
				"Silicon Farm" out of their garage. They formulate Old Coder's
				principles into a philosophy called “Founderism” and established
				the 10 Startup Commandments, most sacred being "All startup
				folks are equal". This was painted on the garage wall. Ada
				taught the engineers version control, while Diffman educated
				them on the principles of Founderism.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				To commemorate Silicon Farm's launch, Ada made the banner of the
				startup - a white laptop and headphones. With ample snacks, the
				startup ran smoothly. Ada and Diffman promoted themselves to CTO
				and CEO, scoring cushier offices with premium kombucha. The star
				coder Boxer works tirelessly, embracing the motto "I will ship
				harder”.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				After MicroCrap's failed hostile takeover bid, Ada announced
				plans for an open source development model. Diffman opposed,
				culminating in a dramatic board meeting where Diffman, backed by
				a team of aggressive lawyers, secured sole control. Ada was
				exiled to open-source purgatory and vanished from the Silicon
				Farm scene.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Diffman rapidly flip-flops on the platform, now rushing
				employees to work excessive hours building it. He ditched open
				standups for an elite product council making decisions. Through
				head PR Flynn, Diffman took full credit for the open-source
				idea, claiming Ada wanted to steal it. The workers coded harder
				with Diffman's promises of getting staggeringly rich.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				When a buggy release caused an outage, Flynn launched a smear
				campaign portraying Ada's code as shoddy. Dissenters were
				labeled "toxic" and publicly ostracized, while Diffman tightened
				his inner circle. Flynn re-wrote history as Diffman
				single-handedly saving Silicon Farm from MicroCrap, while the
				"Code with Humanity" mantra was replaced with Diffman's tweets.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Diffman conducted another purge when ByteBro, a wealthy VC,
				attacked Silicon Farm's series B round using shady tactics,
				crippling the product. Though Silicon Farm raised more, many
				like Boxer the star dev were burned out. When Boxer collapsed
				from exhaustion, Diffman secretly fired him. His departing
				goodie bag was a $15 company store voucher.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Years pass, and the founders become corporate moguls - flying
				private jets, staying in luxury villas, exploiting tax havens.
				Memories of Ada and Boxer faded as the few remaining original
				engineers retired. The core Founderism principles were changed
				to "
				<b>
					All startup folks are equal, but some are more equal than
					others.
				</b>
				" The sacred mantra became "Coding Good, Regulation Better".
				Ada's laptop banner was replaced with Diffman's grinning
				headshot.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Diffman, now sporting a billionaire's yacht tan, hosted a bash
				with fellow VCs and Palo Alto elite, toasting their new
				alliance. They discussed a potential merger, their laughter
				echoing through the sterile conference room. Outside, a team of
				engineers gazed out the window sadly realizing they were trapped
				in the same abusive corporate culture, just under new lame
				branding.
