		<p>
			- what im creating I'm creating a game of gifs similar to quiplash
			or cards against humanity. - objective to figure out how to use ai
			effectively as dev tooling to increase speed and quality. -
			pre-requisite u need to have a technical requirements documentation.
			this isn't as much needed to communicate with peers as much as
			needed to communicate with gpt. best to create hld for frontend and
			backend as well. - frontend made in react and tailwind. - file
			structure recommended by chatgpt. - problem : need to give too much
			context to the softwares. - solution: github copilot is expensive.
			used coda. - problem : I want initial solution to be generated auto.
			it should run and test itself and tell me when its completed. - used
			autogpt. - problem: I want to convert wireframes to html which can
			be used as reference. - solution: used makereal.tldraw.com flow :
			wireframe a component -> get html -> insert it in chatgpt to get
			idea of components and such. - backend made in flask and postgres. -
			api design and file structure recommended by gpt. flow: autogpt
			writes the whole api -> use coda to query and fix issues on it.
			Here's the final product.
