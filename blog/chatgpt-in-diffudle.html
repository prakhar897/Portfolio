		<h1>Using ChatGPT to Automate an AI Art Game</h1>

		<p>
			I created an AI Art based Wordle type game called
			<b>Diffudle</b> (Dead, unfortunately). In short, you are given
			images created using hidden “prompts” which you have to guess. For
			the MVP, I used to generate images myself and upload them to a
			database. Between selecting prompts, styles, and images; it takes me
			around 30 mins to do this. Since this is a daily game, doing this
			every day quickly became a timesink. I realized this is a crisis
			which I need to solve.
		</p>

		<h2>Old Way</h2>
		<p>
			I used to visit generative art sites like
			<a href="https://lexica.art/" target="_blank" class="article-a"
				>lexica.ai</a
			>
			to search for similar prompts. I used styles from other prompts to
			generate images. Eg: If the prompt is “cavemen selfie”. The actual
			images will be generated from the following phrases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				cavemen selfie, drawn by inexperienced artistically - challenged
				1 4 - year - old in class in 2 0 minutes when bored, bad
				proportions, bad art, ink pen, scratchy, no shading, red eyes,
				angry
			</li>
			<li>
				cavemen selfie, in the style of Valorant by Cushart Krentz and
				Gilleard James, Fierce expression 4k, 8k, HDR, Trending on
				artstation, Behance, Pinterest
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Here's the actual images generated for the above game. The images
			are stylistically different but all of them are still kind of doing
			the same thing.
		</p>

		<h2>New Way</h2>
		<p>
			I started using ChatGPT to create prompts with immediate results. I
			asked GPT to generate phrases for me with the given prompt and
			here's what it came up with:
		</p>
		<img src="../images/blog/gptText.png" alt="Cavemen Pic (Improved)" />
		<p>
			Impressive!! It contains different aspects of the same prompt which
			can be used to generate images. Here's the final images. You can see
			that the images now describe the prompt instead of just drawing it.
		</p>
		<img
			src="../images/blog/gptResult.png"
			alt="Cavemen Pic (Descriptive)"
		/>

		<h2>Automating the Whole Game</h2>
		<p>At this point, I could've automated the whole game:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>ChatGPT to generate appropriate prompts for the word.</li>
			<li>lexica.ai API to get differing styles for the Image.</li>
			<li>Stable Diffusion API to create images.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Since all this is paid, I decided to wait until this project starts
			generating some revenue before buying a subscription to these.
