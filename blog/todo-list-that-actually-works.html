		<h1>A TODO List that actually works</h1>

		<h3><i> 07 Sep 2023 </i></h3>
		<p>
			I've seen countless apps, methodologies, scientism, talks,
			conversations on TODO Lists to the point it has spun into its own
			genre. Let me outline some methodologies and why they don't work.
			Then I'll talk about what really worked well for me at least.
		</p>

		<h2>Approaches That don't work</h2>

		<h2>1. A giant List</h2>
		<p>
			This offers <b>no prioritization</b>, you will often miss important
			tasks. Eventually, it will also become overwhelming when hundred
			chores are staring down at you all the time. <br />
			<br />
			How to solve this: Organize your tasks.
		</p>

		<h2>2. TODO Apps</h2>
		<p>
			Cool you say, Let's organize them using a <b>TODO app</b>. This is
			the worst option by far. These apps have slick UI but the whole
			point of the list is to motivate yourself to do the task. The
			feeling you get crossing a line on a paper is unmatched compared to
			touching on an app. Further, these apps just hide your achievement
			so you'll be even less incentivized. <br />
			<br />
			How to solve this: Use paper-pen/whiteboard instead of these apps.
		</p>

		<h2>3. Four Quadrant/ Similar Methodologies</h2>
		<p>
			If you've ventured deep into productivity lore, you'll know there's
			something called the "Four Quadrant Method" [2]. In brief, you split
			your tasks into four sections:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Important, Due Soon</li>
			<li>Important, Not Due Soon</li>
			<li>Not Important, Due Soon</li>
			<li>Not Important, Not Due Soon</li>
		</ol>

		<img
			src="../images/blog/todo_list/covey_quadrants.png"
			alt="Covey Quadrants"
		/>

		<p>
			The strategy is to pick the tasks in the priorities given above.
			This means you'll be able to pick all the important tasks first.
			<br />
			<br />

			I liked this approach initially but eventually realized: ”Tasks are
			not the same. Get milk, write an essay, plan a vacation, reconnect
			with a friend. These are things of different magnitude, different
			emotional connection, different context and time commitment.” [1]
			<br />
			Quadrant just means you miss the essence of the task, why it's
			important and why you should do it.
		</p>

		<h2>Consequence based Approach (works for me)</h2>
		<p>
			I moved a step back into the giant list. But now with each task,
			I'll write a consequence of not doing it. <br />
			<br />

			Ex:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			Task - Apply to JS Conference <br />
			<br />

			Consequence - Not being able to attend JS Conf.
		</blockquote>

		<img src="../images/blog/todo_list/ex1.jpeg" alt="Example Task" />

		<p>
			It's Sunday night and I pick up this task. Then I play
			Counter-Strike for the rest of the night. In the morning, I can
			either decide to keep this in the pile or if the pile has grown too
			much, I'll just cross this out meaning I accept the consequences of
			not doing this.
		</p>

		<img src="../images/blog/todo_list/ex2.jpg" alt="Task Comparisons" />
		<p>
			This helps in keeping my priorities sorted. Not doing the day job
			tasks have harsher consequences than this, so I'll naturally pick
			those out first. You can also mix the four Quadrant approach here
			but I found it to be overkill. <br />
			<br />

			If the list grows large, this means I'm struggling to let go. At
			this point, It's important to remind myself that as an adult, there
			are things I will miss in life. And it's strangely relieving. <br />
			<br />

			Another benefit is that, this help you uncover truths about your
			values. Like if you're pursuing a field only because your parents
			wants you too. The consequence here would be “disappointed parents”.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b> Note </b> - DO NOT make a task out of things you love to do. I
			did not make a task of “playing video games”. If you like them so
			much, you'll make space for it and accept consequences of not doing
			other tasks. Making it a task will only diminish the joy.
