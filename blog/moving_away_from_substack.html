		<h1>Moving Away from Substack</h1>

		<h6><i> 17 Nov 2023 </i></h6>

		<p>
			I tried Substack. It was fine, I suppose. But truth be told, I
			failed to find any compelling reason why it stood out from platforms
			like Medium.
		</p>

		<p>
			Back in the day, Medium was a welcoming space where folks shared
			their technical insights and more. However, if you visit it now, you
			might notice a disheartening transformation. It's become a cluttered
			space, resembling spam-filled sites like Quora or even Google's
			over-optimized front page.
		</p>

		<p>
			They seem desperate for revenue, drowning the site in SEO tricks and
			gating most publications behind a paywall. It's frustrating to be
			lured in by promising articles only to hit a dead end behind a
			payment prompt.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, I don't mean to be harsh on Medium, but it's clear to me that
			they've outgrown their prime and are now scrambling for every penny
			before potentially fading into obscurity or being swallowed by a
			faceless conglomerate, much like Vox or Tumblr.
		</p>

		<p>
			One aspect that deeply concerns me is the fate of the independent
			writers who wrote content on Medium. All their efforts have gone to
			vain. They have to start from scratch on a new platform.
		</p>

		<p>
			But let's be honest, Substack won't be exempt from the chase for
			cash forever [1][2]. When that day comes, all the hard work of
			writers will vanish alongside it. Sure, you can notify your
			subscribers about the move, but a lot people like to directly visit
			the blog instead of subscribing.
		</p>

		<p>
			But... Substack emails your newsletters directly to the readers and
			provides the option to export your email list right??. I'm sure
			these will the axed as soon as profitability becomes an issue since
			they provide a nice lock in.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hence, I've taken control by self-hosting my content. No more
			worries about paywalls or unexpected demands. Best of all, I can
			tinker with the design and layouts as I wish. I still maintain my
			cherished list of subscribers, albeit with a little more manual
			effort.
		</p>

		<p>Thanks for Reading!!</p>
